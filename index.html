    <h2><span>PRIVASEE</span></h2>
    <p><span>2019<br>
HTML/CSS, Video, TouchDesigner, Adobe Premiere<br>
This project is an exploration of my growing paranoia over my digital footprint and privacy.<br>
An ominous eye watches me from behind my own camera as my screen distorts and moves away from me, <br>
symbolizing a transfer of my data to corporations who will use it against me.

    <h2><span>INTERACT WITH INTERCAT</span></h2>
    <p><span>2019<br>
HTML/CSS, Video<br>
I made this net art project as a comfort to myself, as I was missing my cat friends, Gordo and Mel.<br>
I wanted to recreate my time with them by using video footage to produce a sense of virtual interaction with the cats.

    <h2><span>RUINS</span></h2>
    <p><span>2019<br>
Photo, Video, TouchDesigner, Adobe Premiere<br>
I collaborated with my classmate, Matteo Leva to create this installation project, which consists of a video and a destroyed book.<br>
The video is a digital rendition of the book, and both are glitched out. <br>
An iPad screen playing the video is placed inside the destroyed pages of the book and viewers are encouraged <br>
to explore both the video and the book, as well as the connections between the two.<br>
The subject of the book and video is The Colosseum. <br>
While Matteo worked on the physical aspects of the installation, the ruined book and tablet that would be fit inside,<br>
I worked on the digital video art that would play on the tablet placed inside the book.

    <h2><span>CLASH<span></h2>
    <p><span>
2019<br>
Video, Adobe Premiere<br>
See what I see. This short film is a piece of my mind where memories collide with and distort one another.<br>
I used a collection of video footage that I saved from random events from my life for the very purpose of producing some form of video art.
